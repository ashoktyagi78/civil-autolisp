# Profiles in AutoCAD

Profiles store drawing environment settings. You can create profiles for different users or projects, and you can share profiles by importing and exporting them as files.

Profiles store settings such as the following:
* Default search and project file paths
* Template file locations
* Initial folder specified in file navigation dialog boxes
* Default linetype and hatch pattern files
* Printer defaults

Profile information is typically set on the _Files_ tab of the _Options_ dialog box, stored in the system registry, and can be exported to a text file (an `ARG` file).

# Workspaces in AutoCAD
Workspaces are sets of menus, toolbars, palettes, and ribbon control panels that are grouped and organized so that you can work in a custom, task-oriented drawing environment.

When you use a workspace, only the menus, toolbars, and palettes that are relevant to a task are displayed. In addition, a workspace may automatically display the ribbon, a special palette with task-specific control panels.

# CUI files in AutoCAD
There are 3 types of CUI files:
* Partial CUIs
* Main CUI
* Enterprise CUI

Profiles control Main CUI and Enterprise CUI.

Main CUI and Enterprise CUI control Partial CUIs.
